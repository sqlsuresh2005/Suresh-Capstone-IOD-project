Business problem :


How can educational institutions leverage predictive analytics to 
identify at-risk students early in their academic journey, 
thereby reducing dropout rates and enhancing overall student success?


Data problem :

The data science problem related to predicting student dropout rates involves several critical components:

Data Integration and Quality: 
Combining diverse data sources, including demographic, academic performance, and engagement metrics, while ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the data is essential for building reliable predictive models. Inconsistent or missing data can significantly affect model performance and insights drawn from the analysis12.

Feature Engineering: 
Identifying and creating relevant features that capture the complexity of student experiences is crucial. This includes not only traditional academic metrics but also behavioral engagement data, such as interaction frequency with university resources and peer networks23.

Model Selection and Evaluation: 
Choosing the right machine learning algorithms to accurately predict dropout risks is vital. This involves testing various classification models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests) and evaluating their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores to ensure robustness against false positives and negatives14.

Handling Class Imbalance: 
Addressing the imbalance in dropout vs. retention rates in the dataset is necessary to avoid bias in predictions. Techniques such as resampling, synthetic data generation, or using specialized algorithms designed for imbalanced datasets can help improve predictive accuracy34.

Timeliness of Predictions: 
Developing a model that can provide early predictions based on limited initial data (e.g., first semester performance) is crucial for timely intervention strategies aimed at at-risk students24.
By addressing these challenges, educational institutions can effectively implement data-driven strategies to enhance student retention and success rates.
